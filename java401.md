## Java Notes from 401-Java reading

1. [Arrays, Loops, Imports](#Arrays)




#### Arrays Loops Imports

Types of loops are 
- Simple `for` loop
- Enhanced `for-each` loop
- `While` loop
- `Do-While` loop

1. For Loop
    - A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

2. While Loop
    - The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

3. Do-While Loop   
    - The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
